Hacking on python-tdbus
=======================

I have tried to keep the module simple. The things that probably contributed
most to this are the following:

* Python-tdbus does not share the D-BUS connection with other users in the
  same process.

* Dispatching is implemented in Python instead of using the libdbus
  dispatching. 

* Arguments to D-BUS messages are provided using native Python types driven by
  a format string.

Adding a new Event Loop
=======================

See the file "gevent.py" on how to add an event loop. It comes down to two
things:

 * Implement an EventInterface subclass that implements your file description
   watch operations.

 * Implement a subclass of Dispatcher that intializes the EventInterface and
   connects it to your event loop. You may also need to implement the
   dispatch() and call_method() operations.

Note that unlike dbus-python, you do not need to implement event loop
integration in C! It can be done comfortably in Python.

Sending patches

Please open a ticket on the Github site and send an email to the list.

Future work
===========

Some ideas for the future:

 * Provide a Proxy object that acts as a local proxy of a D-BUS object (like in
   python-dbus). The proxy object should use the Introspectable interface to
   find out method signatures. This would remove the need to provide argument
   format strings.

 * Add more event loop interfaces.

 * Re-investigate the Python vs libdbus dispatching again.
